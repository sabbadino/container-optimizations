preferSideWithBiggestSurfaceAtTheBottomWeight // prefer to place boxes that can be rotated to have the largest surface area at the bottom 
preferMaximizeSurfaceContactWeight // prefer to maximize surface area of a box against the lower boxes (it seems very expensive )
preferLargeBaseLowerWeight // prefer boxes with larger surface on the bottom  , that is, encourages boxes with larger lower surfaces to be placed lower in the container.

sabbadino-ca: if i give differnt optimazation parameters (model.Maximize / model.Minimize)  , how do i control a balance of importance and prirority among them 

GitHub Copilot: In OR-Tools CP-SAT, you can control the balance and priority among multiple objectives using two main approaches:

### 1. Weighted Sum Objective
Combine your objectives into a single expression using weights that reflect their relative importance:
```python
model.Maximize(weight1 * expr1 + weight2 * expr2 - weight3 * expr3)
```
- Choose weights (weight1, weight2, ...) to prioritize objectives. Larger weights make an objective more important.
- Example: To maximize boxes on the floor and minimize total height, use:
  ```python
  model.Maximize(1000 * sum(on_floor_vars) - sum(z[i] for i in range(n)))
  ```
  Here, maximizing boxes on the floor is much more important than minimizing the total height.

### 2. Lexicographic (Hierarchical) Optimization
Solve for the most important objective first, then fix its value and optimize the next objective:
- Step 1: Solve for the primary objective and record its optimal value.
- Step 2: Add a constraint to fix the primary objective to its optimal value, then optimize the secondary objective.
- Repeat for further objectives.

**Example:**
```python
# 1. Maximize boxes on the floor
model.Maximize(sum(on_floor_vars))
solver.Solve(model)
max_on_floor = solver.ObjectiveValue()

# 2. Fix primary objective, then minimize total height
model.Add(sum(on_floor_vars) == int(max_on_floor))
model.Minimize(sum(z[i] for i in range(n)))
solver.Solve(model)
```
This ensures the secondary objective is only optimized among solutions that are optimal for the primary.

---

**Summary:**
- Use a weighted sum for a soft balance (tune weights for importance).
- Use lexicographic optimization for strict priority (primary must be optimal before secondary is considered).
